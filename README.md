# Promise You'll Come Back To Me

Promise You'll Come Back To Me (or Promise you'll return to me) is a game about love, loss, and complex error hendeling strategies. In it you play as Captain Charles Fort (from the album The Life, Death, And Persistence Of Captain Charles Fort by the band The Wiggly Tendrills).

Having lost your memory you must attempt to navigate the mysterious Sargasso sector using you ships Promise Engine. To do this you will have to submit ship movement comands as well formatted promises.As you progress you can ask you shipboard A.I. for more information about your past, the Sargassothe sector, how to create well formatted promises, or why well formatted promeses are important (e.g. if a movement brings you into a wormhole and you accidnetally start your next movement before exiting the wormhole then you could slam into a warp wall and disintegrate).

## Why

I created this game because while learning javascript development I was having a hard time understanding promises. I belive that this is partially because there are not a lot of good analogies for promises available to new developers. Most tutorials already assume you have experience with asynchronous functions and have run into situations where you would want to use promises. In addition to providing a more easily understandable analogy for asynchronous calls (unstable wormhole jumps) to new developers, making the game forced me to develop a solid understanding of promises. During development I had to build the logic of the game to match the actual logic of promises and also make sure that the analogy made sense at all times. I also wound up using a few promises myself along the way.
